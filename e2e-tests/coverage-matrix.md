# E2E Test Coverage Matrix

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive mapping of test coverage across core user journeys in the OWASP Juice Shop application. The coverage matrix helps track which user flows are tested and identifies areas that may need additional test coverage.

## Test Coverage by User Journey

| User Journey | Feature/Challenge | Test Files | Coverage Status | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Registration | User account creation | `registration.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests form validation, successful registration |
| Login/Logout | Authentication | `login-logout.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests login with valid/invalid credentials, logout |
| Product Search | Product discovery | `product-search.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests search functionality, filtering, SQL injection |
| Basket Management | Shopping cart | `basket-checkout.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests adding/removing products, quantity changes |
| Checkout Process | Purchase completion | `checkout-process.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests address entry, payment methods, order confirmation |
| API Integration | Backend services | `api-integration.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests API endpoints for products, user data, basket |
| User Profile | Account management | `user-profile.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests profile viewing/editing |
| Security Challenges | Security testing | `security-challenge.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests security vulnerabilities |
| Product Reviews | User feedback | `product-reviews.spec.ts` | ✅ Complete | Tests adding/viewing product reviews |

## Functional Coverage Summary

- **Core Flows Coverage**: 9/9 (100%)
- **Test Count**: 69 tests across all user journeys
- **Headless Mode Support**: All tests updated to support headless execution
- **CI Integration**: Tests configured to run in GitHub Actions workflow

## Implementation Details

### StorageService Implementation
A robust `StorageService` utility has been implemented to handle localStorage access in headless mode:

- Detects headless mode through environment variables and browser characteristics
- Provides fallback in-memory storage when localStorage isn't accessible
- Implements the full localStorage API (getItem, setItem, removeItem, clear)
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

### Test Execution in CI
Tests are configured to run in GitHub Actions with the following parameters:

- Headless mode enabled
- Parallel execution for faster feedback
- Retries configured to handle flaky tests
- Increased timeouts for stability

## Areas for Future Improvement

- Add more edge case testing for checkout process
- Enhance error handling in API integration tests
- Improve test stability in headless mode for UI interactions
