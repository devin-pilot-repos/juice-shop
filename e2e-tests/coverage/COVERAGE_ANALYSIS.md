# E2E Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Coverage Status

Based on the coverage report, we've identified the following coverage gaps:

### Critical Workflows

1. **User Registration** (0% coverage)
   - Has 1 test mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Ensure test reliability and add tests for edge cases

2. **User Login/Logout** (0% coverage)
   - Has 4 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for password reset and account lockout

3. **Product Search** (0% coverage)
   - Has 4 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for filtering and sorting

4. **Basket Management** (0% coverage)
   - Has 6 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for quantity updates and coupon application

5. **Checkout Process** (0% coverage)
   - Has 4 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for different payment methods

### High Importance Workflows

1. **User Profile Management** (0% coverage)
   - Has 0 tests mapped
   - Recommendation: Create tests for profile viewing and editing

2. **Security Challenges** (0% coverage)
   - Has 3 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add more tests for common security vulnerabilities

3. **API Interactions** (0% coverage)
   - Has 3 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for error handling and authentication

4. **Score Board** (0% coverage)
   - Has 5 tests mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for challenge completion tracking

### Medium Importance Workflows

1. **Product Reviews** (0% coverage)
   - Has 1 test mapped but not executed
   - Recommendation: Add tests for review moderation and rating

## Test Gap Analysis

### Missing Test Coverage

1. **User Profile Management**
   - No tests currently mapped
   - Need to create tests for:
     - Viewing user profile
     - Editing user details
     - Changing password
     - Viewing order history

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Limited test coverage for different payment methods
   - Need to add tests for:
     - Credit card validation
     - PayPal integration
     - Cryptocurrency payment

3. **Error Handling**
   - Limited tests for error scenarios
   - Need to add tests for:
     - Network errors
     - Server errors
     - Input validation errors

### Recommendations for Improving Coverage

1. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Create tests for User Profile Management (highest priority gap)
   - Add error handling tests to existing workflows
   - Improve test reliability in CI environment

2. **Medium-term Improvements**
   - Add tests for different payment methods
   - Create tests for product filtering and sorting
   - Add tests for coupon application and discounts

3. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Add performance testing for critical workflows
   - Create tests for accessibility compliance

## Coverage Target

The target is to achieve â‰¥80% functional coverage across all workflows, with priority given to:
1. Critical workflows (target: 90%)
2. High importance workflows (target: 80%)
3. Medium importance workflows (target: 70%)

## Next Steps

1. Run the coverage report with actual test results to get a baseline
2. Prioritize creating tests for User Profile Management
3. Enhance existing tests to improve reliability in CI environment
4. Update the coverage report weekly to track progress
