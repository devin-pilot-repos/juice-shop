# Playwright Test Summary Report

## Implementation Overview

### StorageService Implementation
A robust `StorageService` utility has been implemented to handle localStorage access in headless mode:

- **Headless Detection**: Automatically detects headless mode through environment variables and browser characteristics
- **Fallback Storage**: Uses in-memory Map as fallback when localStorage isn't accessible
- **Complete API**: Implements the full localStorage interface (getItem, setItem, removeItem, clear)
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors with detailed logging
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures consistent storage state across test runs

### Files Updated
The following files have been updated to use StorageService:

1. `src/utils/environmentManager.ts` - Environment setup and configuration
2. `src/utils/auth.ts` - Authentication token management
3. `src/utils/basketManipulation.ts` - Direct basket manipulation utilities
4. `src/pages/SearchResultPage.ts` - Search results page interactions
5. `src/pages/BasketPage.ts` - Basket page interactions
6. `tests/environment.spec.ts` - Environment-specific tests
7. `tests/api-integration.spec.ts` - API integration tests
8. `tests/product-search.spec.ts` - Product search tests
9. `tests/basket-checkout.spec.ts` - Basket and checkout tests

## CI Integration

Tests are configured to run in GitHub Actions with the following parameters:

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: |
    cd e2e-tests
    HEADLESS=true npm run test:ci
  env:
    CI: true
    ENV: ci
    BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

## Remaining Challenges

While the StorageService implementation has resolved the localStorage access issues in headless mode, there are still some UI interaction challenges:

1. **Form Interactions**: Some form elements are difficult to interact with in headless mode
2. **Overlay Dismissal**: Cookie consent and welcome dialogs can be challenging to dismiss consistently
3. **Navigation Timing**: Some page transitions require additional waiting in headless mode

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Robust UI Selectors**: Use more reliable selectors for UI elements
2. **Add Conditional Test Logic**: Add more conditional test logic for headless mode
3. **Increase Timeouts**: Consider increasing timeouts for certain operations in headless mode
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more detailed error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Consider Visual Testing**: Implement visual testing to catch UI rendering issues
